My first app made in React. Here I have passed an array of objects from Data component to an App with a map() method, 
so than we can pass the data from App to a child component - Card.
Also I have separated different parts of a page into separate components to make it more convenient and readable.
That helped me to practice a concept of using props as reusable components, pass data from parent to child components, working with objects and map() method.
